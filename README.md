# glsl-math
This does not do anything interesting yet.

More details:

* A texture is created using a canvas
* It is used in GLSL, to be copied on another canvas
 
Eventual future goals (might never happen):

* Store numbers/data in the texture with arbitrary precision
* Generate GLSL scripts to perform math operations on the data passed with the texture
* (Or write a math parser in GLSL)
* Make it work without visible canvas in the screen and pack everything in a nice library
* Make it also work with a visible canvas. Example: you type an equation and you see the live result...
